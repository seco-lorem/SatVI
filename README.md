# SatVI
Craiglist-like WebSite.\
I've first started this project with its frontend, using it as a learning and testing playground during internship.\
Last week of internship I've started learning backend with help of an intern friend. After Internship, I had to disconnect it from company's backend so I decided to build the backend to see it working again.\
It is not finished, as it was never intended to be.\
It is now live on https://satvi.yektaseckinsatir.com/ for demonstration\
Demo database is hosted as read-only. You may use:\

## I Will be updating (hopefully) with instructions on running it in your local environment
